# My-Wave-Portal

A smart contract app to record and retrieve waves and messages sent by users on the chain.
Occasionally a user will win some ethers for sending love with a message ðŸŽ‰. 
(It is currently deployed on a test network)

The frontend for this is at https://replit.com/@josh-01/waveportal-starter-project#src/App.jsx 

Made using hardhat and solidity.

I built this as part of a [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) project cohort.
