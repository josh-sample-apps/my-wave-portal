# My-Wave-Portal

A smart contract app to record and retrieve waves and messages sent by users on the chain.
Occasionally a user will win some ethers for sending love with a message ðŸŽ‰.

The frontend for this is at https://replit.com/@josh-01/waveportal-starter-project#src/App.jsx 

Made using hardhat and solidity.

I built this as part of a buildspace project cohort : https://app.buildspace.so/projects/CO02cf0f1c-f996-4f50-9669-cf945ca3fb0b
