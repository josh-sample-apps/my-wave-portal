# My-Wave-Portal

A smart contract app to record and retrieve waves and messages sent by users on the chain.
Occasionally a user will win some ethers for sending love with a message 🎉. 

The frontend for this is at https://replit.com/@josh-01/waveportal-starter-project#src/App.jsx 

Made using hardhat and solidity.

I built this as part of a [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) project cohort.

## To use the app :

This is currently deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network, 
and you would need to do the following to access the web page: (You can skip to step 6 if you already have a wallet account connected to Rinkeby network with some ethers in it)

1. Install the MetaMask plugin for your browser at https://metamask.io/download
2. Create a wallet (If you don't already have one), or import your existing wallet

4. Connect to the Rinkeby Test Network in your metamask plugin :
- Click on Account icon > Settings > Advanced Settings > Show test networks > Enable

- Then select the Rinkeby test network here:

5. Get some ethers from a Rinkeby Faucet : https://rinkebyfaucet.com/ 

6. `Connect Wallet` from my app web-page:

7. You should now be able to wave and send me a message, and you might also win ethers (but only on the test network for now 😸 ) !
