# My-Wave-Portal

A smart contract app to record and retrieve waves and messages sent by users on the chain.
Occasionally a user will win some ethers for sending love with a message ðŸŽ‰. 

The frontend for this is at https://replit.com/@josh-01/waveportal-starter-project#src/App.jsx 

Made using hardhat and solidity.

I built this as part of a [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) project cohort.

## To use the app :

This is currently deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network, 
and you would need to do the following to access the web page:

1. Install the MetaMask plugin for your browser at https://metamask.io/download
2. Create a wallet (If you don't already have one), or import your existing wallet

4. Connect to the Rinkeby Test Network in your metamask plugin

5. `Connect Wallet` from my app web-page:

6. You should now be able to wave and send me a message, and you might also win ethers (but only on the test network for now ðŸ˜¸ ) !
